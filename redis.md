 <summary><b>Install Redis on Windows</b></summary>

Redis, a powerful open-source in-memory data store, is widely used for various applications. 

While Redis is often associated with Linux, you can also run it on Windows 10 using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2). 

This compatibility layer allows you to execute Linux commands natively on Windows, providing a seamless environment for running Redis.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up and run Redis on Windows 10 using WSL2:

### Step 1: Enable Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run the following command to enable WSL2:

**`Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux`**

Reboot your system (this step is necessary only once).

### Step 2: Install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store

Launch the Microsoft Store. Search for "Ubuntu" or your preferred Linux distribution. Download and install the latest version of Ubuntu.

**`start ms-windows-store:`**

**Enter New User & Password**

Launch the installed Ubuntu distribution. In the terminal, execute the following commands:
```
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:redislabs/redis
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get install redis-server
```
**Note**: The sudo command might be required based on your system's user configuration.

### Step 4: Restart Redis Server

After installation, restart the Redis server using:
```
sudo service redis-server restart
```
### Step 5: Verify Redis Installation

Test the Redis connectivity using the redis-cli command:
```
redis-cli
```
Inside the Redis CLI, execute the following commands:
```
127.0.0.1:6379> set user:1 "Jane"
127.0.0.1:6379> get user:1
```
You should see "Jane" as the output.

### Step 6: Stopping the Redis Server

To stop the Redis server, use the following command:
```
sudo service redis-server stop
```
Running Redis on Windows 10 through WSL2 provides you with a Linux-like environment where you can harness the full power of Redis for your projects. 

Remember that while Redis databases by default have indexes from 0 to 15, you can adjust this configuration as needed in the redis.conf file.

By following these steps, you can easily set up and run a Redis database on your Windows 10 machine using the Windows Subsystem for Linux. 

This enables you to leverage Redis for various applications and projects seamlessly.

  <summary><b>Redis Configuration</b></summary>
  
### Redis CONFIG Command
The proper way to configure Redis is by providing a Redis configuration file, usually called redis.conf (available at root the directory of redis). Though Redis is able to start without a configuration file using a built-in default configuration, however, this setup is only recommended for testing and development purposes.

The redis.conf file contains a number of directives, here is the format :

> keyword argument1 argument2 ... argumentN
Here is an example of configuration directive:

> slaveof 127.0.0.1 6380
### Changing Redis configuration while the server is running :

It is possible to reconfigure Redis on the fly without stopping and restarting the service or querying the current configuration programmatically using the special commands CONFIG SET and CONFIG GET. Not all the configuration directives are supported in this way, but most are supported as expected.

Here is the basic syntax of redis CONFIG command is shown below:

> redis 127.0.0.1:6379> CONFIG GET CONFIG_SETTING_NAME
### Example:

> 127.0.0.1:6379> config get save 
1) "save" 
2) "900 1 300 10 60 10000"
Use * in place of CONFIG_SETTING_NAME to get all configuration settings.

 <summary><b>Redis Data Types</b></summary>

### Data Types
 Redis is not a plain  key-value store, actually, it is a data structures server, supporting a different kind of values. In traditional  key-value stores, you associated string keys to string values, in  Redis the value is not limited to a simple string, but can also hold more complex data structures. The following is the list of all the data structures supported by Redis:

Binary-safe strings.
Lists
Sets
Sorted sets
Hashes
Bit arrays (or simply bitmaps)
HyperLogLogs:
### Redis keys:

Redis keys are binary safe (meaning they have a known length not determined by any special terminating characters), so you can use any binary sequence as a key, from a string like "foo" to the content of a JPEG file. The empty string is also a valid key. Here are some rules about keys:

The maximum allowed key size is 512 MB.
Very long keys are not a good idea.
Very short keys are often not a good idea. While short keys will obviously consume a bit less memory, your job is to find the right balance.
Try to stick with a schema. For instance "object-type:id" is a good idea, as in "user:1000". Dots or dashes are often used for multi-word fields, as in "comment:1234:reply.to" or "comment:1234:reply-to".
### Redis Strings:

Strings are  Redisâ€™ most basic data type. It is the only data type in  Memcached, so it is also very natural for newcomers to use it in Redis. Since Redis keys are strings, when we use the string type as a value too, we are mapping a string to another string. The string data type is useful for a number of use cases, like caching HTML fragments or pages. Here are some common commands associated with strings:

SET: sets a value to a key
GET: gets a value from a key
DEL: deletes a key and its value
INCR: atomically increments a key
INCRBY: increments a key by a designated values
EXPIRE: the length of time that a key should exist (denoted in seconds)
Strings can be used to store objects, arranged by key.

127.0.0.1:6379>  SET newkey "the redis string"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> GET newkey
"the redis string"
### Redis Lists:

Lists in  Redis are a collection of ordered values. This is in contrast to Sets which are unordered. Redis lists are implemented via Linked Lists. This means that even if you have millions of elements inside a list, the operation of adding a new element in the head or in the tail of the list is performed in constant time. Here are some common commands associated with lists:

LPUSH: Add a value to the begriming of a list
RPUSH: Add a value to the end of a list
LPOP: Get and remove the first element in a list
RPOP: Get and remove the last element in a list
LREM: Remove elements from a list
LRANGE: Get a range of elements from a list
LTRIM: Modifies a list so leave only a specified range
### Example:

redis 127.0.0.1:6379> lpush w3resourcelist redis
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> lpush w3resourcelist mongodb
(integer) 2
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> lpush w3resourcelist rabitmq
(integer) 3
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> lrange w3resourcelist 0 10

1) "rabitmq"
2) "mongodb"
3) "redis"
### Redis Sets:

 Redis Sets are unordered collections of strings. If you want to combine strings, you can do that with  REDIS sets. Here are some common commands associated with sets:

SADD: Add one or members to a set
SMEMBERS: Get all set members
SINTER: Find the intersection of multiple sets
SISMEMBER: check if a value is in a set
SRANDMEMBER: Get a random set member
Sets can be helpful in various situations. In sets each member of a set is unique, adding members to a set does not require a "check then add" operation. Instead the set will check whether the item is a duplicate whenever an SADD command is performed.

### Example:

redis 127.0.0.1:6379> sadd w3resourcelist redis
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> sadd w3resourcelist mongodb
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> sadd w3resourcelist rabitmq
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> sadd w3resourcelist rabitmq
(integer) 0
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> smembers w3resourcelist

1) "rabitmq"
2) "mongodb"
3) "redis"
### Redis Sorted sets:


Sorted sets are a data type which is similar to a mix between a Set and a Hash. Like sets, sorted sets are composed of unique, non-repeating string elements, so in some sense, a sorted set is a set as well.

However, while elements inside sets are not ordered, every element in a sorted set is associated with a floating point value, called the score (this is why the type is also similar to a hash, since every element is mapped to a value). Here are some common commands associated with sorted sets :

ZADD: Adds members to a sorted set
ZRANGE: Displays the members of a sorted set arranged by index (with the default low to high)
ZREVRANGE: Displays the members of a sorted set arranged by index (from high to low)
ZREM: Removes members from a sorted set
### Example:

redis 127.0.0.1:6379> zadd w3resourcelist 0 redis
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> zadd w3resourcelist 0 mongodb
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> zadd w3resourcelist 0 rabitmq
(integer) 1
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> zadd w3resourcelist 0 rabitmq
(integer) 0
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> ZRANGEBYSCORE w3resourcelist 0 1000

1) "redis"
2) "mongodb"
3) "rabitmq"
### Redis Hashes:

Hashes in  Redis are useful to represent objects with many fields. They are set up to store a vast amount of fields in a small amount of space. Here are some common commands associated with hashes:

HMSET: Sets up multiple hash values
HSET: Sets the hash field with a string value
HGET: Retrieves the value of a hash field
HMGET: Retrieves all of the values for given hash fields
HGETALL: Retrieves all of the values for in a hash
### Example:

In the following example hash, data type is used to store user's object which contains basic information of a user.

redis 127.0.0.1:6379> HMSET user:1 username w3resource password 123456 points 200
OK
redis 127.0.0.1:6379> HGETALL user:1

1) "username"
2) "w3resource"
3) "password"
4) "123456"
5) "points"
6) "200"
### Redis Bit arrays (or simply bitmaps):

It is possible, using special commands, to handle String values like an array of bits: you can set and clear individual bits, count all the bits set to 1, find the first set or unset bit, and so forth.

HyperLogLogs:

This is a probabilistic data structure which is used in order to estimate the cardinality of a set.
